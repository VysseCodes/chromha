#                  Costs nothing: both variants already exist in the same file
#                  and the client picks. Assumes dark mode means night, which
#                  is usually but not always true.
#   Follow sun   - night icons whenever sun.sun is below the horizon. Accurate
#                  regardless of theme, at the cost of a theme rewrite and a
#                  frontend reload at sunrise and sunset.

# --- Weather icons ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# 51 icons ship with the integration. Home Assistant only defines 19 weather
# conditions, so the surplus is used three ways:
#
#   * day/night pairs, for every condition that has one
#   * intensity tiers, driven by the condition itself
#   * the rest published on the palette sensor as `icon_library`, so cards can
#     use them directly for things HA has no condition for (frost, sleet,
#     tropical storm)
#
# `{dn}` is substituted with -day or -night.
#
# The -1/-2/-3 suffixes in the icon set are precipitation intensity, so they
# are chosen by the condition, not by the user. Home Assistant already draws
# the distinction it can: `rainy` versus `pouring`. A theme supplies one URL
# per condition and the weather card reuses it for forecast rows, so an icon
# that tracked current intensity would put today's rain rate on next week's
# forecast.
